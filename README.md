# Zero Motorcycles Home Assistant Integration

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This project is an attempt to create an integration to consume services provided by
Zero Motorcycles for their 3rd gen electric motorcycles that come with integrated
cellular connection and cloud service.

## How

All you need for this integration to work is your login. That is the username
and password you use for the official Zero Motorcycles app.

Currently not available in default HACS repo because that requires me to make a brand first.

For now you either have to install it manually by dropping the custom_components
folder contents into your HA installation. Or by adding this repo as a custom
repo within HACS. For that, within HACS just select "add repo" then pick "integration"
as type and enter a name and the url of this repo. Or read here https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/

Then you can add a new integration, search for "Zero" to find this one:

Next you'll get a quick installation wizard, enter your credentials here:

Once done this integration should be visible:

An example of all the data it fetches. Note that in later releases sensor names
have been adapted to include unit numbers so that these can be created for all
units in case someone owns more than 1 zero motorcycle.

## Why?

Because we can!

## Limitations

This is literally my first Home Assistant integration so there is still a lot to
do and as of now there are still some limitations. Here is an attempt to describe those:

* Coordindator is hardcoded to update every 5 minutes, if you need more you'll have to
change that manually for now. For this search for the `(minutes=5)`line in the `coordinator.py`
file and change it to what you prefer.

## Upcoming features

* parse numeric values (if needed that is)
* allow user to configure update interval from UI
